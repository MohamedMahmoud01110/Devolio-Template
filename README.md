# Devolio-Template
The DevFolio website is a responsive, three-page portfolio built primarily with the Bootstrap framework. It utilizes the Bootstrap grid system to ensure consistent and adaptable layouts across devices. Each page—Main, Portfolio, and Blog—employs different combinations of Bootstrap’s classes to create a clean, professional design.
